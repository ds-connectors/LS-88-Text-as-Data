## 1) [Discussion Questions](https://goo.gl/forms/ntlWvawLdmdb8kPA2)

1. What are the pros and cons of analyzing text using metadata as opposed to textual data? Is one more successful than the other?

2. Near the end of the 18th century, novel titles shrank in size from a median of 20 words to six words. After the great shrinking, titles started to diversify from short descriptions of people and places, to abstractions and metaphors. Do you believe that this diversification in title names has more to do with the physical constraints of the time (an expanding market, limited catalogue space) or separate authors’ creativity of what a novel’s purpose is?

3. Why does Moretti think that literary form is worth studying?

## 2) Summary

Moretti analyzes 7000 titles of 18th-19th century British novels to describe how studying something as ‘small’ as the title can be extremely illuminating in studying the literary past. His article is structured into three central concepts: Describing the major metamorphosis that happened with 18th century titles (titles became shorter due to market growth), how that metamorphosis shaped the reader's expectations of novels (shorter titles left more imagination for the reader), and how quantifying linguistic features of a title can point to a relationship with genre (exemplifying this using Gothic novels).

## 3) Level of Engagement/Analysis

Moretti’s engagement with his study of 7000 titles is prominent. He uses statistics to show a correlation between the decrease in lengthy titles and the increase of the literary market. He finds clusters within the semantics of the titles based on the different parts of speech (adjectives, nouns, and articles) and performs quantitative stylistics. Overall, Moretti’s analysis is backed by a strong selective usage of data.

## 4) Argument/Stakes

The author makes three distinct arguments:

1. The 18th century saw a large shift in novel title length that changed its purpose from a short synopsis of the narrative to an incredibly short phrase or even a word that would draw the reader in. There is a possible causation; the market of novels existed almost exclusively in the library because people rarely about novels. As the number of novels grew, there wasn’t enough physical space to put longer titles, and shorter titles caught the reader’s eye more.

2. As shorter titles grew in popularity, they attempted a completely different approach towards selling the novel. Short titles tried to describe the mundane made extraordinary, an exotic “thing,” or an abstract concept.

3. Authors learned how to compress the meaning and style of their novels’ genres by putting small article cues in titles that have statistical significance in indicating the genre. Ultimately, Moretti argues that titles have had a historically multifaceted purpose. It has changed over time due to physical constraints but also because as the market for books grew so did the competition between novels. Writers as a result adapted to the new market that was designed to enchant readers with the unusual. Moretti argues that titles have in fact evolved to inform readers either obviously or subliminally of what type of novel they are reading and that they should read it.

## 5) Method

Moretti’s method was incredibly straightforward. His first argument only required counting the amount of words in a British novel title in a given timeframe. For his second and third arguments, he employs only a slightly different method: he still counts title lengths but also the frequency of the different types of short novel names when converted into parts-of-speech (for example, article-noun, proper-noun, article-adjective-noun).

## 6) Issues

The logic to his rhetoric is evident and there are no assertions he makes that immediately strike one as being far-fetched for the narrative of 18th century novel market. One may wonder if there are other conclusions that a literary expert may come to in interpreting the data.

The only glaring issue found with the paper was the ineffective use of data visualization. It is unclear whether this paper was produced with color in the graphs or more contrast between the points of data, but as the paper was presented it was hard to determine the trends that Moretti was citing. Rather than contributing to clarity and comprehension of the paper, the graphs were cryptic and hard to decipher in context of where they were used.

## 7) Reproducibility/Transparency

Moretti never formally defines the sources of the data set he created and then used to define this study (only within the footnotes are the sources given). He spends very little time indicating how he is constructing his data set, and while one can take what he says at face-value, the question of curating data comes to mind. However, given the straightforward nature of the project and data analysis he does, it is plausible that one could recreate the same dataset through their own efforts. Moretti also admits that some of the formulas and conclusions he drew from the data may only be conclusive when compared to other work in European markets. This leads into the broader application of this methodology due to the open-ended question and need for further work done for Moretti to want to make definitive statements on the phenomena he observed.

## 8) Broader Application

As already said, the broader application of this methodology is continuing the study of novel markets throughout Europe during the 18th century in order to determine changes in title length. Moretti ends on a poetic note in describing how the fragments of literature that are often so overlooked can be utilized in order to understand broader trends.

Metadata as a method of digital humanities research often allows for one to create quantifiable data out of something that may not be quantifiable in and of itself. It is fairly painless to create categories of data based on categorizations and classifications alone, which allows for an extensive analysis of a corpus, even when the works themselves are fragmented or incomplete.
