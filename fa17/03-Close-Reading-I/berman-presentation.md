# Moretti, "Operationalizing"

Casey Li and Sarah Jiang

## 1) [Discussion Questions](https://goo.gl/forms/42p6OXmVa2vueyfX2)

1. Can any of Berman’s arguments about “Das Urteil” be operationalized? Can those arguments even be quantified or, more importantly, proved to be correct? 

2. Did your own assessment about “Das Urteil” and its messages agree with Berman’s? If yes, what did you agree on? If no, what did you differ on and did Berman’s analysis convince you?

3. Compare and contrast Berman and Moretti’s works. How does Berman convey his arguments for the topics discussed? How do you feel Berman’s rhetoric measures up against approaches that are more data based?

4. Berman references "data" a couple times in his articles (85, 86), specifically regarding the data of Kafka's life, or "objective exernal data", and "personal information" (86). Is there a way we can harness this data for a computational analysis of Kafka's works? 

5. Part of Berman's argument depends on Kafka's writing style or specific words ("alternating between objectifying description and subjective point of view", "use of indexical terms" (88)). How might we measure these aspects?

## 2) Summary

Berman understands “Das Urteil” as structurally, an allegorical tale cautioning readers of the fallacies inherent in the inevitable process in passing judgement, and stylistically, an implicit criticism of established literary forms through its thematic ambiguity and subversive pseudo-realism.

## 3) Level of Engagement/Analysis

Berman engages deeply with the text. He does not limit himself to isolated aspects (character-space, stichomythia) like Moretti does—Berman analyzes the outside influences of the contemporary culture and Kafka’s personal experiences as well as a variety of literary devices such as the characterization of and contrast between George and his father. He also has a particular fondness for diction analysis, as illustrated through his investigations of particular keywords. 

## 4) Argument/Stakes

Berman makes numerous arguments throughout his essay, most of them attempting to analyze a particular aspect of “Das Urteil”:

1. The parallelism of “Das Urteil” and Franz’s life does not subtract from the story’s genius (86)
2. The breakdown of literary realism through the marginalization of detail (88-89)
3. And the contrast between the beginning and the end (90-91)
4. The fallacies of the character’s arguments that contribute to an ultimately absurd judgement (93-94) 
5. Georg’s betrayal of the people around him due to his own weakness and the symbolism of that weakness derived from closure as the “culture of modernity” (97-98) 

## 5) Method

Berman does a ‘conventional,’ non-digital, non-computational literary analysis that relies on a close reading of the text and incorporated auxiliary knowledge of the historical and biographical context.

## 6) Issues

1. Berman’s analysis relies on a certain amount of personal interpretation. Likewise, there is a certain degree of personal choice in deciding which outside influences such as historical context or biographical context to take into account in the analysis of the text. Additionally, there is a certain barrier to reproducibility because conventional literary analysis relies heavily on understanding of previous scholarship.

2. I (Sarah) tend to disagree with Berman’s views on Georg as a betrayer to the people surrounding him. To betray means that he was first loyal and then turned on them. However, Georg is the product of a closed culture - did he ever even possess the ability to be loyal? Because if he was never loyal, then he doesn’t satisfy the prerequisites of betrayal.

## 7) Reproducibility/Transparency

This article was written exclusively using humanistic conclusions without any real data analysis. Hence, reproducibility of Berman’s conclusions (if even possible) is highly subject to the individual doing the reproduction.

## 8) Broader Application

His analysis, by virtue of its close reading methodology, is deeply text-specific and is not easily generalized across works of literature. The method of close reading, however, is transferable and can be employed to analyze other prose works.
