# The Starry Night

Anne Sexton

---

That does not keep me from having a terrible need of — shall I say the word — religion. Then I go out <br>
at night to paint the stars. – Vincent Van Gogh in a letter to his brother

The town does not exist <br>
except where one black-haired tree slips <br>
up like a drowned woman into the hot sky. <br>
The town is silent. The night boils with eleven stars. <br>
Oh starry starry night! This is how <br>
I want to die. <br>

It moves. They are all alive. <br>
Even the moon bulges in its orange irons <br>
to push children, like a god, from its eye. <br>
The old unseen serpent swallows up the stars. <br>
Oh starry starry night! This is how <br>
I want to die: <br>

into that rushing beast of the night, <br>
sucked up by that great dragon, to split <br>
from my life with no flag, <br>
no belly, <br>
no cry. <br>
