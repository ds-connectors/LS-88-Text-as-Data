## A Poet to his Beloved

I bring you with reverent hands <br>
The books of my numberless dreams; <br>
White woman that passion has worn <br>
As the tide wears the dove-gray sands, <br>
And with heart more old than the horn <br>
That is brimmed from the pale fire of time: <br>
White woman with numberless dreams <br>
I bring you my passionate rhyme.

## Hope against Hope

Is it then wasted, all the long endeavor? <br>
Are they all lost, those pearls of price untold? <br>
Those years of love and labor gone forever? <br>
Lavished in vain, my heart's best gems and gold?

Nay, O my Lord! I laid my whole soul's treasure, <br>
All that I loved or longed for, at thy feet, — <br>
Tread Thou upon my purple at thy pleasure! <br>
Gather my scattered pearls, and thus complete

My heart's one longing. —not as I had planned it, <br>
But as Thou wilt. I trust thy changeless truth. <br>
I welcome life, Lord, as Thou shalt command it, <br>
Thou know'st the lost endeavors of my youth.

And somewhere, yet, I hope to find the beauty <br>
Of flowers springing from these long lost seeds; <br>
Under thy hand divine that path of duty <br>
May teem with flowers, where now I see but weeds.
