# Thornbury, "The Poet Alone"

Krutika Ingale & Anne Fogarty

## 1) [Discussion Questions](https://goo.gl/forms/B4jLtZiF120eJRNs2)

1. How are the Renovator from *Christ and Satan* and Bede similar? How are they different? Examine the effect of their positions in poetic communities on their literature.

2. Is Thornbury’s experimentation enough to prove that *Christ and Satan* had multiple authors? What methods did she use to gather and organize her data? 

3. What are the differences between how Thornbury analyzed *Christ and Satan* and how she analyzed the works of Bede? Is one approach more scientific than the other?

4. Can we really use data analysis to draw conclusions about literature that dates back to Anglo-Saxon England and earlier? Why might the results of such analyses be misinterpreted?

5. On page 183, Thornbury states that

> “Christ and Satan needs a new edition, amended to conform to the Renovator's idea of Old English.”

In this quote, Thornbury states that the Renovator’s work in the poem needs to be “fixed” so that the “new” version would align more to the Renovator’s intent. Even if specialists today do extended research on Old English poetry, could they be able to truly produce a piece that the Renovator preferred? 

## 2) Summary

Thornbury analyzes *Christ and Satan* and concludes that the poem is made up of at least two authors: the first is a knowledgeable poet who is well educated in Old English verse and metre and the second, whom she refers to as the “Renovator”, is a poet who is isolated from the poetic community of the time and thus tries to imitate and replicate patterns found in the first poet’s work in his additions to the poem. She compares this “Renovator” to the English monk and poet, Bede, who even though was well-connected to the poetic community of Anglo-Saxon England, was still isolated due to his personal beliefs. Out of this such independence grew some of Bede’s most powerful works. 

## 3) Level of Engagement/Analysis

Thornbury is very engaged with *Christ and Satan*. For almost half of her paper she is focused on analyzing the poem’s authorship. She thoroughly examines the context in which the poem was written. She discusses and analyzes *Christ III*, *Guthlac A* and *Juliana*, poems from other authors during the time period. She also mentions the positions of the poets in their respective poetic communities during the Anglo-Saxon period. Thornbury directly discusses the poem and also includes references to the works of other poets. Thornbury can not make many concrete conclusions about the life(s) of the poem’s author(s). But, she does state that the poem has at least two authors. One author was knowledgeable in Old English poetry, while the other was an isolated poet without the guidance of a poetic community.  Her focus is more on the structure of the poem, rather than the meaning of the poem. She analyzes the patterns in meter, rhyme, and alliteration of different poems when trying to identify the multiple authorship of the piece. She examines the poem in units of fitts.

## 4) Argument/Stakes

Thornbury states that *Christ and Satan* is written by at least two authors. The first author had insight about Old English poetry in the poetic community, while the second poet, the “Renovator”, taught himself Old English poetry and was unintentionally isolated from the poetic community. She further claims that the English monk, the Venerable Bede, was an isolated poet, even though he had many social connections, due to his radical and independent views. Bede brought this solitude to himself.

Her arguments are important, because they certainly help shed light to the fact that poetic isolation and poetic acceptance from the community visibly affects the work of certain poets, and thus the history of Anglo-Saxon society as a whole.

The excerpt is a central part of Thornbury’s argument. If the excerpt was not written, Thornbury would not have been able to give an example of a poet whose isolation was due to circumstance rather than personal choice like the cause of Bede’s isolation. 


## 5) Method

**Stylometry**: The study of linguistic style that is commonly used to attribute authorship to documents. It analyzes specific patterns within a text to determine. Computers have enhanced stylometry methods because they can quickly and accurately interpret mass data. Methods include 

- Thornbury divides the poem *Christ and Satan* into thirteen fitts and uses data to survey patterns of alliteration.
> “As internal units, I used fitts as indicated in the manuscript with enlarged capitals and line divisions…”(163)

- Thornbury looks at the alliteration type, syntax, and metre within each fitt.
> “I have in each instance determined the alliterative patterns most common for each individual fitt.”(163)

- Thornbury visualizes the data on graphs and tables in order to identify common patterns, repetition, variation and anomalies from fitt to fitt. She then looks more closely at “sites of disjunction” to see if they support her argument that the poem has multiple authors.
> “The statistics on alliteration do point to likely sites of disjunction.”(164)

- Thornbury analyzes the data and conclusions about authorship by combining her observations of *Christ and Satan* with prior knowledge about the Old English corpus.

**Overview of Methods**:

Thornbury states that we can find how poets are different by finding how much of a fitt is occupied by lines alliterating on the most common patterns. To find these patterns, she divided each poem into fitts and counted the amount of alliteration of certain letters in each fitt of each poem. She then displays her results in tables and graphs for each poem. 

When analyzing Bede, she does line by line analyses of metre and syntax patterns of certain works of Bede and relevant authors. She cites specific examples of Old English texts, provides a modern translation for them, and then incorporates her historical analysis to the examples to make claims about Bede’s career and mindset.


## 6) Issues

It is not necessarily ethical to revise a poet’s work centuries later. It is impossible to know the author or the Renovator’s original purpose, and therefore we cannot alter work without changing the meaning. Thornbury states that

> “...the ideal editor of Christ and Satan would have the difficult task of retracing the Renovator’s steps, and working out what his idea of metre actually was”(183).

However, trying to reconstruct the work of the Renovator without Renovator’s actual input is not only discrediting his efforts, but is also making the piece less authentic. The possible reconstruction of *Christ and Satan* could also be affected by the personal biases from our contemporary culture.

She also makes many inferences about the Renovator when it is not even confirmed that there is a second author. Though she backs these arguments with data and examples of other works, she makes claims that air on the side of speculation. For example, she says, 

> “we see someone tiptoeing on rules he does not quite understand, clinging to the guideline of repeatable formulas.”

She then continues to make detailed, complex arguments constructed on this inference, without concrete justification.

A solution to these issues would be to leave the original piece as it is and not try to alter the past, because it would stain the authenticity of the literature. However, it is still beneficial to analyze the text in order to understand the technical issues of the Renovator’s alterations.

## 7) Reproducibility/Transparency

The data for the alliteration tests would probably be reproducible. Having found the same patterns in alliteration could lead us to the same conclusion. We could create code to count which letters are repeated and where they are repeated in the different fitts. The code and the data is not easily accessible. 

Thornbury does not go into lots of detail about her method. Thornbury explains her method, but doesn’t thoroughly go into detail about any  code written or the numerical techniques used to get her results when analyzing Christ and Satan. 

However, the results on analyzing metre and structure of poetry, especially for the works of Bede and other authors, are hard to be reproduced through code, for it instead requires a line by line, “old-school” version of analysis. 


## 8) Broader Application

Thornbury primarily focuses on analyzing the quantity and patterns of alliteration,  however these numerical techniques can be applied to other literary devices. For example, we can also quantify rhyme, repetition, punctuation and syntax. This data can the be used to make hypotheses about the context of the pieces. The line by line analysis approach that Thornbury also includes is very standard and can be used to analyze almost any piece of prose.
